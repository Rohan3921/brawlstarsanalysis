# Conclusion

In summary, we were able to determine that\
-certain brawlers are more prevalent in certain modes\
-there are specific times and game modes to gain trophies faster and easier\
-unclear whether some game modes are easier than others\
-popular brawlers do not always have the highest win rates \
\
Overall, this dataset shows that all players trend upwards in trophies. We determined that specific combinations of times, brawlers, maps and game modes were favorable for gaining trophies, at least for high skill players. While this data set seems to be comprised of higher skill players, the game seems to be generally fair from our analysis.
