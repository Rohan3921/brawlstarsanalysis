## Interactive Graph Notes

Our interactive graph displays all the brawlers in our dataset, colorcoded by their specific "class" from the game. We calculated their pick rates (how often a brawler is used) and their win rates and plotted them against each other. From there, we created 4 categories:\
Overrated: high pick rate and low win rate\
Easy to play: high pick rate and high win rate\
Unpopular: low pick rate and low win rate\
High Skill: low pick rate and high win rate\
